				In Business - I think if Health will permit it is a very good thing to be in the workshops at 2pm to see all

				Saturdays I think the time for the one who takes duty might be 8 to 3 short cold lunch making 57 hours which is more than the 
				workman make to make up for the the following week he has but 50 hours to make and which with probable over minutes will bring the
				working Masters hours to an average of 54 Hours weekly as at present worked in shops
